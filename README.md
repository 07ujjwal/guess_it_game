# guess_it_game
The traditional guess-the-number game has been given some additional levels of difficulty.

Each level's fundamental gameplay requirement is the same. With a change in level,
the only thing that changes is the range of numbers within which you are choosing your number.
For your first try to find the number in the appropriate domain, you will be given 20 chances on any level.
Your chances will be cut in half if you keep switching between the levels. 
remember to look for hints in the final two levels.
